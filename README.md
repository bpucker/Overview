## (5) Project Specific Repositories

### (5.1) Evolution of _FNS I_ in the _Apiaceae_ ###
Scripts associated with our analysis of the _FNS I_ evolution in the Apiaceae are available in the [ApiaceaeFNS1](https://github.com/bpucker/ApiaceaeFNS1) repository. Please find additional details in our preprint [_Apiaceae FNS I_ originated from _F3H_ through tandem gene duplication](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.16.480750).

The [CoExp](https://github.com/bpucker/CoExp) repository contains several scripts associated with a co-expression analysis. This includes the preparation of count tables with kallisto. The actual co-expression analysis is also available through our [webserver](http://pbb.bot.nat.tu-bs.de/CoExp/).

### (5.3) Expression analysis in pitaya ###
The scripts in the [pitaya](https://github.com/bpucker/pitaya) repository were developed and applied to refute two publications about pigments in this Caryophyllales plant species. Please find additional details in our publication [The report of anthocyanins in the betalain-pigmented genus _Hylocereus_ is not well evidenced and is not a strong basis to refute the mutual exclusion paradigm](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-03080-9) and preprint [The evidence for anthocyanins in the betalain-pigmented genus _Hylocereus_ is weak](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.16.468878).

### (5.4) Long Read Walker ###
The [LongReadWalker](https://github.com/bpucker/LongReadWalker) allows to close gaps between contigs of long read assemblies. All reads are screened for overlaps with the flanking contigs. Matches are used to extend contigs. An iterative approach is similar to the walking strategy deployed in the early days of genome sequencing when primers were placed at the border of known sequences to 'walk' into unknown sequences. The LongReadWalker tries to close a gap starting at both flanking contigs. The resulting sequences should match to fully support the gap replacing sequence.

### (5.5) Genotyping GABI-Kat lines with ONT long reads ###
The [GKseq](https://github.com/bpucker/GKseq) repository contains some scripts used for the analysis described in our paper [Large scale genomic rearrangements in selected Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA lines are caused by T-DNA insertion mutagenesis](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07877-8).
